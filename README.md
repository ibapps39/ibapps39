**About Me**
- 👋 Hi, I’m @ibapps39, otherwise known as Ian Brown!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... working out at the gym, fitness, technology, runtime performance optimizations. I love science, philosphy, and history!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Linux kernel and driver development, embedded programming, Nvidia's CUDA, WebAssembly, and Game Programming!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! I'm not huge into SQL and/or database management though (that isn't a no for those projects though).
